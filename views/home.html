                Nice to meet you,

            <p> My name is Jesse Diaz. I wear many hats, and this website is a way of showing you a few of them.
                I have lived most of my adult life outside of America, my home country, but I have repatriated
                and am looking to learn new things and explore my passions. My main interests include programming,
                yoga, and anthropology. I hope that through my work and the things I create, that I can
                demonstrate the beauty and importance of each of these subjects.

            </p>

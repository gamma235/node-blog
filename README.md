This will be a blog built from scratch, without using Connect or Express, to help me to learn more about node web development from a low level.

So far I have made a front page, added a "new post" button that takes the user to a form with a submit and "back/home" button, that leads to a "thank you" page with a "home" button.

Known bugs:

1. On the /posts/new page, the title is not being picked up and parsed.
2. On the /posts/new page, the content text-area starts the cursor in the middle, not to the left.
